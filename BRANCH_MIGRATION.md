# Branch Migration Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Default Branch Changed ✅
- **Old Default:** `master`
- **New Default:** `main`
- **Status:** Successfully updated on GitHub

### 2. Branch Renames ✅
- **Local `master`** → **`master-old`**
- **Remote `master`** → **`master-old`**
- Old master branch preserved as `master-old` for reference

### 3. Cleanup ✅
- Deleted remote `master` branch
- Created remote `master-old` branch with old content
- Set upstream tracking for `main` branch

---

## Current Branch Structure

### Local Branches:
```
* main (tracking origin/main)
  master-old
  001-i-want-app
```

### Remote Branches:
```
origin/main (default)
origin/master-old (archived)
```

---

## Verification Commands

Check default branch:
```bash
git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch"
# Output: HEAD branch: main
```

View all branches:
```bash
git branch -a
```

Check current branch:
```bash
git branch --show-current
# Output: main
```

---

## For Team Members

If team members have local `master` branches, they should run:

```bash
# Update remote references
git fetch origin

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Set upstream
git branch -u origin/main main

# Optionally rename local master
git branch -m master master-old

# Pull latest changes
git pull
```

---

## Why This Change?

1. **Industry Standard:** `main` is now the standard default branch name
2. **Inclusive Language:** Moving away from master/slave terminology
3. **GitHub Default:** New repositories on GitHub default to `main`
4. **Consistency:** Aligns with modern development practices

---

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback:

```bash
# Restore master branch
git push origin master-old:refs/heads/master

# Set master as default (via GitHub UI or CLI)
gh api repos/kafle1/drs -X PATCH -f default_branch=master
```
