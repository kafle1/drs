# Feature Specification: Ball Tracking DRS Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-app`  
**Created**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want app same like https://www.fulltrack.ai/ the idea is same, we use our phone to ball track using our system, its a simple drs system but powerful, IT is a web app, see all theirs and we want it same or similar with all the features loaded, its a paid one and everyone cant affoard it so we are making cheaper power and better than that"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a sports official or user, I want to use my phone to capture video of a ball in play, upload it to the web app, and use the DRS system to track the ball's trajectory, review decisions, and make accurate calls in sports like cricket.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has recorded a video using their phone, **When** they upload the video to the web app, **Then** the system accepts the upload and stores it for processing.
2. **Given** an uploaded video, **When** the user initiates ball tracking analysis, **Then** the system processes the video and generates the ball's trajectory data.
3. **Given** trajectory data is generated, **When** the user views the review interface, **Then** they can see visualizations of the ball path, slow motion, and multiple angles.
4. **Given** the review is complete, **When** the user makes a decision, **Then** the system records the outcome and allows sharing or exporting.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the video quality is low or the ball is partially occluded?
- How does the system handle videos with multiple moving objects?
- What if the upload fails due to network issues?
- How to handle videos from different phone models or cameras?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload videos captured from mobile phones.
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze uploaded videos to track the ball's position and generate trajectory data.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the ball trajectory in an interactive web interface with options for slow motion, zoom, and different viewing angles.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide decision review features similar to DRS, including tools for assessing LBW, run outs, and other sports decisions.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support user accounts for saving and managing multiple reviews [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user authentication method].
- **FR-006**: System MUST offer a cheaper pricing model compared to fulltrack.ai [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific pricing tiers and features].
- **FR-007**: System MUST include all key features from fulltrack.ai [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: detailed list of features from fulltrack.ai].
- **FR-008**: System MUST be accessible via standard web browsers on desktop and mobile devices.
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure data privacy and security for uploaded videos [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention policies].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video**: Represents user-uploaded video files, key attributes: file format, duration, resolution, upload timestamp.
- **Trajectory**: Represents the computed ball path, key attributes: coordinate points, timestamps, velocity data.
- **Review Session**: Represents a decision review instance, key attributes: associated video, decision type, outcome, user notes.
